Each section is independent with clear instruction, and I really liked it. I skipped previous sections other than prerequisites, and get started on "Creating your first workflow". The entire experience was smooth and efficient. Especially the screenshots were helpful to learn about the Ul and locate corresponding buttons/tabs quickly.
